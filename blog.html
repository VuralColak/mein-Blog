      <h2>NASA’s Perseverance Rover Hightails It to Martian Delta</h2>
      <p>
        The rover’s self-driving capabilities will be put to the test this month
        as it begins a record-breaking series of sprints to its next sampling
        location. NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover is trying to cover more
        distance in a single month than any rover before it – and it’s doing so
        using artificial intelligence. On the path ahead are sandpits, craters,
        and fields of sharp rocks that the rover will have to navigate around on
        its own. At the end of the 3-mile (5-kilometer) journey, which began
        March 14, 2022, Perseverance will reach an ancient river delta within
        Jezero Crater, where a lake existed billions of years ago. This delta is
        one of the best locations on Mars for the rover to look for signs of
        past microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a
        complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is
        collecting rock cores for return to Earth – the first part of the Mars
        Sample Return campaign. “The delta is so important that we’ve actually
        decided to minimize science activities and focus on driving to get there
        more quickly,” said Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance’s project
        scientist. “We’ll be taking lots of images of the delta during that
        drive. The closer we get, the more impressive those images will be.”

      <h2>Significant Solar Flare Erupts From Sun</h2>
      <p>
        The Sun emitted a significant solar flare on March 30, 2022, peaking at
        1:35 p.m. EST. NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the Sun
        constantly, captured an image of the event.
        <br />
        Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy. Flares and solar eruptions
        can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation
        signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts. This flare is
        classified as an X-Class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares,
        while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is
        twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense, etc. More
        info on how flares are classified can be found here. To see how such
        space weather may affect Earth, please visit NOAA’s Space Weather
        Prediction Center https://spaceweather.gov/, the U.S. government’s
        official source for space weather forecasts, watches, warnings, and
        alerts. NASA works as a research arm of the nation’s space weather
        effort. NASA observes the Sun and our space environment constantly with
        a fleet of spacecraft that study everything from the Sun’s activity to
        the solar atmosphere, and to the particles and magnetic fields in the
        space surrounding Earth.

      <h2>Greenland Ice, Jupiter Moon Share Similar Feature</h2>
      <p>
        Parallel ice ridges, a common feature on Jupiter’s moon Europa, are
        found on Greenland’s ice sheet – and could bode well for Europa’s
        potential habitability. Parallel ice ridges in Greenland bear a striking
        resemblance to ridges on Jupiter’s ice-encased moon Europa, suggesting
        the moon’s icy shell could be riddled with pockets of water. This
        similarity could greatly improve the odds of NASA’s Europa Clipper
        mission detecting potentially habitable environments on the Jovian moon.
        The spacecraft’s ice-penetrating radar instrument REASON (short for
        Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface) will be
        ideal for conducting such a search. “If there are pockets of water under
        the ridges, we have the right instruments to see them,” said Dustin
        Schroeder, a Stanford University associate professor and coauthor of a
        new study comparing Greenland’s “double ridges” with those of Europa.
        Scientists say evidence gathered so far shows that Europa harbors a deep
        liquid ocean, hidden beneath an ice shell that could be 10 to 15 miles
        (15 to 25 kilometers) thick. Because the ice is so substantial, a big
        question about the moon is whether anything from the deep ocean makes
        contact with the surface – or if contact goes the other way, with
        surface material filtering down to the ocean water. “It’s exciting, what
        it would mean if you have plenty of water within the ice shell,” said
        coauthor Gregor Steinbrügge, a former Stanford researcher who is now a
        planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern
        California. “It would mean the ice shell on Europa is extremely dynamic.
        It could facilitate exchange processes between the surface and the
        subsurface ocean. It could go in both directions.” Potential
        life-sustaining nutrients on Europa’s surface – perhaps deposited there
        by another Jupiter moon, volcanic Io – might find their way to the
        subsurface ocean, he said. And chemicals or other material from the
        subsurface indicating a habitable ocean environment could end up on the
        surface.
